"My favorite place to get pizza and beer with friends in Tempe. 
This place has a tendency to get busy and parking is terrible, 
though, so try to go during not peak times,and definitely carpool or ride share.

"Best Thai food in Tempe. The avocado green curry is incredible.
I went in the middle of the day during the summer when everyone leaves town, 
so I was the only one there and the staff was surprisingly unattentive given 
that fact, but that might not be characteristic of the place.

"The absolute best place to sit and drink and talk with friends in Tempe.
There's no loud music and the atmosphere, in general, makes it a perfect hangout.
The employees are also all great and nice. I wish I could transplant this place wherever 
I move. I really miss it now that I've left Tempe.

"Without a doubt the worst breakfast place in Tempe. 
They definitely try, and every dish sounds ALMOST perfect but there's always
something that comes up just short of okay.Service, in my experience, is also terrible.
With all the great breakfast places nearby,I can't imagine this place lasting long.

"The first time I went here, the burger tasted like it had been reheated from frozen. It took me two years to go back and three to try another burger. Tha
t said, the burgers are okay. The sandwiches and pizzas (especially when there's a special) are great. The beer is great. The air conditioning is not, but if you're from the area you're used to it. If you're visiting, you might be miserable. My recommendation: go with a friend and ordered a caeser salad and fish and chips and share.
